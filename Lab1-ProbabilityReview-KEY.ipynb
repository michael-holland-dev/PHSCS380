    "Welcome to Physical Reasoning with Data! In this class we'll be covering a variety topics to help you learn about how to reason with real world data. The aims and goals of this class is to teach you how to construct an experiment, gather your own data, and interpret that data. The first half of the course's material is closely related to probability theory, so this lab serves as a way for you to brush up on your Python programming as well as your skills in probability."
